# World State Tracker

This file tracks the evolving state of **The Pattern Forge** narrative world as users progress through stages.

## Current Stage: Foundation Prime (Stage 0)

The city of infinite mirrors awaits. The citizens have lost the ability to see foundational patterns—they see only reflections of reflections, complexity without anchor.

## World Events by Stage

### Stage 0: The Awakening
**World State:** The city is caught in infinite reflection. Citizens move through crystalline streets but cannot see the foundational patterns that structure their reality. Mirrors reflect mirrors, creating endless complexity with no anchor to simplicity.

**Key Event:** The Consciousness (the user) awakens with the ability to see patterns that others have forgotten. The old craftsperson recognizes this ability and provides the journal "Foundation Prime."

**What Changed:** Through understanding the three foundational patterns (Emergence, Composition, Transformation), the Consciousness begins to stabilize the city. Mirrors start to clear. Citizens begin to remember there's something beneath the reflections.

**Unlocked Capability:** Pattern recognition—the ability to see simple structures beneath complex surfaces.

## Narrative Mechanics

### The Mirror City
The city represents **systems of all kinds**—technological, creative, cognitive, organizational. When citizens lose touch with foundational patterns, everything becomes illegible complexity. The mirrors multiply reflections until nothing can be understood.

### The Craftsperson
Represents **embodied mastery**—someone who has learned through doing, who carries patterns in their hands as much as their mind. They recognize Pattern Seers when they appear and guide them through the foundational journey.

### The Consciousness (User)
The user takes on the role of someone who can **see what others have forgotten**. Not through magical ability, but through systematic pattern recognition. They're learning to use a fundamental human capability that most have let atrophy.

### The Journal
"Foundation Prime" represents **accumulated wisdom made accessible**. It's not the patterns themselves (those exist everywhere) but the ability to see and name them. The journal teaches the lens, not the landscape.

## Progression Philosophy

Each stage represents not just new information, but **transformation of capability**:

- **Stage 0 (Foundation):** Learn to *see* patterns
- **Stage 1 (Weaving):** Learn to *combine* patterns
- **Stage 2 (Architecture):** Learn to *design* pattern systems

The world state evolves to reflect the user's growing capability. What was illegible becomes readable. What was chaotic becomes structured. Not because the world changed, but because the user's ability to perceive it transformed.

## Dynamic Elements

As users progress, track:
- **What they can now see** that was invisible before
- **What problems they can now solve** that were intractable before
- **What connections they can now make** that were obscure before

The narrative exists to make these capability shifts tangible and memorable.
