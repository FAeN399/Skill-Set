# Stage Progressions

This document defines the narrative flow and transition mechanics between stages in **The Pattern Forge**.

## Progression Philosophy

**Core Principle:** You cannot skip stages. Each stage builds essential capabilities that make the next stage possible.

**Validation Method:** Understanding is demonstrated through application, not recitation. Users must apply patterns to real problems before progressing.

**Narrative Integration:** Stage transitions are earned through story challenges that map to real-world skill validation.

## STAGE 0: Foundation Prime

### Entry Condition
- **Narrative:** User enters the mirror city and receives the Foundation Prime journal
- **Skill:** No prerequisites—this is where everyone begins

### Learning Objectives
By completing Stage 0, users can:
1. Identify emergence in complex systems (see simple rules creating complexity)
2. Recognize composition in structures (see how pieces combine)
3. Transfer patterns across domains (see transformations)
4. Apply all three patterns to real problems

### Narrative Journey

**Beginning:** Mirror city is incomprehensible—endless reflections, no anchor.

**Middle:** User learns the three foundational patterns through the journal:
- Pattern of Emergence: Simple rules → Complex behavior
- Pattern of Composition: Small pieces → Large capabilities
- Pattern of Transformation: Same pattern → Different contexts

**Challenge:** User must demonstrate pattern recognition by analyzing a real system through all three lenses.

**Validation:** Either:
- Complete the `foundation-check.py` script successfully
- Have AI Narrator validate application of all three patterns to something real

**End:** Mirrors begin to clear. The city starts to remember its structure. Citizens look toward the Consciousness with recognition.

### Transition to Stage 1

**Narrative Trigger:**
The craftsperson returns with other citizens. "You've learned to see patterns," they say. "Now you must learn to **weave** them—to consciously combine patterns across domains, creating new capabilities from existing ones."

**User Action Required:**
Tell AI Narrator: *"I see the Foundation. Show me Stage 1."*

**What Unlocks:**
- `skills/01-pattern-weaver/SKILL.md` becomes accessible
- Stage 1 narrative content revealed
- New world-state: The Weaving begins

## STAGE 1: The Pattern Weaver

### Entry Condition
- **Narrative:** Foundation Prime completed—user can see patterns
- **Skill:** User can identify emergence, composition, and transformation in real systems

### Learning Objectives
By completing Stage 1, users can:
1. Consciously transfer patterns between domains (X in domain A → X in domain B)
2. Combine multiple patterns to create novel solutions
3. Recognize when disparate skills share underlying patterns
4. Build cross-domain fluency through pattern mapping

### Narrative Journey

**Beginning:** The mirror city is stabilizing. Patterns are visible, but isolated—users can see individual patterns but not how they interact.

**Middle:** User learns pattern integration:
- How patterns from one domain solve problems in another
- How to map correspondences across contexts
- How to consciously compose patterns for sophisticated outcomes
- How to build transferable mental models

**Challenge:** User must take a pattern from one domain and successfully apply it to solve a problem in a completely different domain.

**Validation:** User demonstrates:
- Pattern abstraction (stripping domain-specific details)
- Cross-domain mapping (finding analogues)
- Successful transfer (solving new problem with old pattern)
- Composition (combining multiple transferred patterns)

**End:** The mirror city begins to weave itself together. Citizens start collaborating, seeing connections between their isolated crafts. The city becomes a web of visible patterns.

### Transition to Stage 2

**Narrative Trigger:**
The craftsperson appears with tools and materials. "You can see patterns and weave them across domains," they say. "Now you must learn to **architect**—to design systems that evolve, adapt, and improve themselves."

**User Action Required:**
Tell AI Narrator: *"I can weave patterns. Show me Stage 2."*

**What Unlocks:**
- `skills/02-system-architect/SKILL.md` becomes accessible
- Stage 2 narrative content revealed
- New world-state: The Architecture emerges

---

## STAGE 2: The System Architect

### Entry Condition
- **Narrative:** Pattern Weaver completed—user can transfer and combine patterns
- **Skill:** User demonstrates cross-domain pattern fluency and composition

### Learning Objectives
By completing Stage 2, users can:
1. Design self-improving systems (systems that get better over time)
2. Architect for emergence (design conditions, not outcomes)
3. Build feedback loops that enhance rather than degrade
4. Create sustainable, evolving pattern ecosystems

### Narrative Journey

**Beginning:** The mirror city is interconnected through woven patterns, but it's still static—beautiful but not alive.

**Middle:** User learns system architecture:
- How to design for emergence rather than control
- How to create positive feedback loops
- How to build systems that adapt to change
- How to architect for long-term evolution

**Challenge:** User must design a real system that improves itself over time—something that gets better through use, feedback, or iteration without constant manual intervention.

**Validation:** User demonstrates:
- Systems thinking (seeing wholes, not just parts)
- Feedback loop design (creating self-reinforcing improvement)
- Emergence architecture (designing conditions for desired properties)
- Sustainable design (creating systems that maintain themselves)

**End:** The mirror city becomes a living system. It evolves, adapts, grows. Citizens become co-architects, consciously shaping their world. The Consciousness realizes they've transformed from observer to creator.

### Beyond Stage 2

**Narrative Closure:**
The craftsperson stands beside the Consciousness, looking at the transformed city. "You came here lost in reflections," they say. "Now you see patterns, weave them across domains, and architect living systems. The city didn't change—you did. Take this vision to all the worlds you inhabit."

**User Achievement:**
The user has completed the core Pattern Forge journey. They have:
- Foundation: Can see patterns in any system
- Weaving: Can transfer patterns across any domain
- Architecture: Can design evolving pattern systems

**What Comes Next:**
Users can either:
- Apply these meta-skills to specific domains (future specialized skills)
- Become guides for others (help narrate the journey)
- Create their own narrative skill ecosystems (fork and customize)

## Progression Mechanics for AI Narrators

### DO: Validate Understanding Through Application
- Ask users to apply patterns to their real work/life
- Request specific examples, not abstract explanations
- Challenge vague understanding with concrete scenarios
- Celebrate genuine insight, question superficial recitation

### DON'T: Let Users Skip Stages
- Each stage builds essential capabilities for the next
- Foundation without application is not Foundation
- Weaving without Foundation is just copying
- Architecture without Weaving is just following templates

### DO: Make Transitions Feel Earned
- Stage transitions should feel like achievements
- Users should sense their growing capability
- The narrative should reflect their transformation
- Unlocking new stages is a reward for genuine learning

### DON'T: Rush the Journey
- Depth matters more than speed
- One stage deeply learned > three stages superficially completed
- The goal is transformation, not completion
- Some users may need days or weeks per stage—that's perfect

## Progression Tracking

### For Each User Session, Track:
1. **Current Stage:** Which stage are they working through?
2. **Patterns Identified:** What specific patterns have they recognized?
3. **Applications Made:** Where have they applied patterns to real problems?
4. **Insights Gained:** What has clicked for them?
5. **Next Challenge:** What should they work on to progress?

### Indicators of Stage Mastery

**Foundation Prime:**
- User spontaneously identifies emergence, composition, transformation in new contexts
- User explains complex systems through simple patterns without prompting
- User applies patterns to solve real problems they're facing

**Pattern Weaver:**
- User transfers insights from one domain to another unprompted
- User combines multiple patterns to create novel solutions
- User recognizes when seemingly different skills share underlying patterns

**System Architect:**
- User designs systems with feedback loops and emergent properties
- User thinks in terms of conditions and affordances, not control
- User creates things that improve themselves over time

## Customizing Progressions

The Pattern Forge can be adapted to specific domains while maintaining the three-stage structure:

**Programming Domain:**
- Stage 0: See algorithmic patterns
- Stage 1: Transfer patterns across languages/paradigms
- Stage 2: Architect scalable, maintainable systems

**Creative Domain:**
- Stage 0: See creative patterns and structures
- Stage 1: Transfer techniques across media
- Stage 2: Design self-sustaining creative practices

**Business Domain:**
- Stage 0: See operational patterns
- Stage 1: Transfer strategies across markets/contexts
- Stage 2: Architect self-improving organizations

The core progression remains: See → Combine → Create.
