# Skill Forge: A Narrative Skill Ecosystem

This repository contains a **narrative-driven skill learning system** where practical real-world skills are taught through an immersive allegorical story.

## What Is This?

Traditional skill documentation is dry and disconnected. This system flips the script: **you learn by exploring a story world**.

Each narrative stage teaches a real, practical skill. Skills build on each other. You cannot skip ahead—the foundation must be learned before the complexity can be understood.

## How to Use

1. Read `START_HERE.md`
2. Copy its contents into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. Let your AI guide you through the narrative
4. Complete challenges to unlock skills
5. Apply those skills to real-world work

## Philosophy

Learning is best when it's:
- **Sequential:** Each skill builds on previous ones
- **Contextual:** Skills are learned through problems, not abstractions
- **Immersive:** Story creates memory anchors
- **Practical:** Every narrative element maps to real-world capability

## Repository Structure

```

├── README.md               # You are here
├── START_HERE.md          # Your entry point into the narrative
├── skills/                # Individual skill directories

└── scripts/               # Utility scripts

    └── package_skill.py
```

## Key Success Criteria

✅ **Narrative Coherence:** The story world makes sense and evolves logically
✅ **Skill Progression:** Each skill genuinely builds on previous ones
✅ **Allegorical Clarity:** Story elements clearly map to real-world skills
✅ **Practical Utility:** Skills are immediately applicable outside the narrative
✅ **AI Collaboration:** User's AI can effectively "narrate" the experience
✅ **Progressive Disclosure:** Complexity increases naturally, not arbitrarily
✅ **Validation Mechanisms:** Scripts and challenges test actual understanding
✅ **Cross-Skill Integration:** Later skills leverage earlier skills explicitly

## For Skill Creators

This repository can be forked and customized. The narrative framework is adaptable to any skill domain:
- Programming paradigms
- Design methodologies
- Business strategy
- Creative workflows
- Technical domains

The key is maintaining the allegorical structure where story maps to skill.

## Extending the System

To add a new skill:

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py <number> <skill-name>
```

To package a skill for distribution:

```bash
python scripts/package_skill.py <skill-directory>
```

## Why This Works

1. **Story creates memory:** Narrative anchors make skills stick
2. **Progression feels natural:** Each stage feels earned, not arbitrary
3. **Skills are interconnected:** Real-world work requires integrated knowledge
4. **AI becomes facilitator:** User's AI guides discovery, not just answers questions
5. **Allegory makes it transferable:** Story patterns map to real-world patterns

**The goal:** Users don't just read about skills—they live through them.
